DevOps Assessment
ðŸš€ DevOps Assessment Task â€“ Yii2 + Docker Swarm + CI/CD + Ansible

Objective:
Deploy a sample PHP Yii2 application using Docker Swarm and NGINX (host-based reverse proxy) on an AWS EC2 instance. Automate setup using Ansible and implement CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

---

ðŸ›  Task Breakdown:

1. Application Deployment

* Use a sample Yii2 PHP application (can be minimal or from GitHub).
* Set up Docker Swarm mode on the EC2 instance.
* Containerize the Yii2 application using Docker.
* NGINX should run on the host, not in a container, and act as a reverse proxy to the Docker container(s).

2. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

* Trigger pipeline on push to main branch.
* Build and push Docker image to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.
* SSH into the EC2 server.
* Pull the new image and update the Docker Swarm service.
* Optional: Implement rollback on failure.

3. Infrastructure Automation with Ansible

* Write Ansible playbook(s) to:
  * Install Docker, Docker Compose
  * Install NGINX, Git, PHP dependencies (if needed)
  * Initialize Docker Swarm
  * Configure NGINX with a reverse proxy to your Yii2 app
  * Clone the repo (if needed)
  * Deploy the app as a Swarm service

4. Deliverables

* GitHub repo with:
  * Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
  * Ansible playbooks
  * .github/workflows/deploy.yml (GitHub Actions)
  * NGINX configuration file
  * README explaining:
    * Setup instructions
    * Assumptions
    * How to test deployment

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Points

* Use GitHub Secrets for environment variables or SSH keys.
* Add health checks in your Docker setup.
* Add Prometheus + Node Exporter for basic monitoring.
